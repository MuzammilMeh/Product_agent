The GitHub repository [MuzammilMeh/Product\_agent](https://github.com/MuzammilMeh/Product_agent/) is designed to employ autonomous agents for analyzing customer data to detect anomalies and provide product-related suggestions. Here's an overview of its structure and components:​

**Repository Structure:**

*   **customer\_data/**:​
    
    *   This directory likely contains sample datasets or customer data files utilized for analysis.​
        
*   **app.py**:​
    
    *   The main application script that orchestrates the analysis process. It presumably loads customer data, employs autonomous agents to detect anomalies, and generates product suggestions based on the findings.​
        
*   **requirements.txt**:​
    
    *   A list of Python dependencies required to run the application. This file ensures that all necessary libraries and packages are installed for seamless execution.​
        

**Setup and Usage:**

To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

1.  bash git clone https://github.com/MuzammilMeh/Product\_agent.git
    

1.  bash Product\_agent
    

1.  bash pip install -r requirements.txt
    

This command installs all the necessary Python libraries specified in the requirements.txt file.

1.  bash python app.py
    

Executing this script initiates the process of loading customer data, analyzing it for anomalies using the autonomous agent, and generating corresponding product suggestions.

**Note:** For detailed instructions, configurations, and customization options, please refer to the repository's documentation or README file. If the README is not available or lacks specific details, examining the source code, especially app.py, can provide further insights into the application's functionality and usage.​
